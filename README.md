# SpeedReader
## Introduction
Everyone has wished they could read faster at some point in their life, 
for example, to get through the required reading for their English class, 
to cram for an exam, or to simply get through their ever-growing list of novels to read.
In this project, we will prototype one approach to speed reading called 
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)—recently popularized by Spritz Inc.
and apps like Spreed—and run some small user studies to test its effectiveness.

## Features
- User can choose the dimension of interface, font size, text suppose to be read, words per minute;
- The center letter of a word is in red for concentration, but other letters are in white;
- When a sentence has more than 10 words, the speed is lower and there is "long sentence warning" for users.
